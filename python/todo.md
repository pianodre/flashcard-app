  - [ ] High contrast mode
  - [ ] Font size options
- [ ] **Customization**

  - [ ] Theme selection
  - [ ] Custom study intervals
  - [ ] Personalized difficulty algorithms
  - [ ] Custom card templates

### Testing & Quality

- [ ] **Comprehensive testing**
  - [ ] Unit tests for all classes

  - [ ] Performance testing

## Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

### DeckManager Implementation Priority Order ✅ COMPLETED

1. **✅ Implement create_deck(self, deck) function** - Create new decks
2. **✅ Implement save_deck(self, deck) function** - Persist decks to JSON files
3. **✅ Implement load_deck(self, deck_name) function** - Load existing decks from storage
4. **✅ Implement add_flashcard(self, deck, flashcard) function** - Add cards to decks
5. **✅ Implement remove_flashcard(self, deck, flashcard) function** - Remove cards from decks
6. **✅ Implement remove_deck(self, deck) function** - Delete entire decks

### Other Tasks

1. **✅ Fix current bugs in console version** - Fixed file loading issues
2. **✅ Implement basic user interaction flow** - Created testDeck() function for studying
3. **✅ Add file-based deck loading** - JSON loading/saving working perfectly
4. **✅ Create comprehensive test suite** - Full DeckManager testing implemented

## Current Status (Nov 8, 2025) 🎉

### ✅ Major Accomplishments Today

- **Complete DeckManager class** with all CRUD operations working
- **Interactive study function** (`testDeck()`) for going through flashcards
- **Difficulty editing system** allowing users to adjust card difficulty during study
- **Robust file handling** with JSON persistence and error handling
- **Comprehensive deck management** (create, edit, delete, view statistics)
- **Import/Export functionality** for .txt files with proper formatting
- **Working deck collection** with Spanish vocab, Math problems, and Python basics

### 🎯 Next Immediate Priorities

## **CURRENT FOCUS: Spaced Repetition Implementation**

### Step-by-Step Implementation Guide:

1. **Update Flashcard class** (`flashcard.py`):

   - [ ] Add `next_review` parameter to `__init__` method
   - [ ] Import `timedelta` from datetime
   - [ ] Add `next_review` field to `to_dict()` method
   - [ ] Create `_calculate_next_review(difficulty)` method:
     - Difficulty 1 (Hard) → 30 seconds (for testing)
     - Difficulty 2 (Medium) → 5 minutes (for testing)
     - Difficulty 3 (Easy) → 1 day
   - [ ] Add `is_due_for_review()` method
   - [ ] Update `edit_flashcard()` to call `_calculate_next_review()`
2. **Update DeckManager class** (`deckManager.py`):

   - [ ] Add `next_review` parameter when loading flashcards in `load_deck()`
3. **Update Deck class** (`deck.py`):

   - [ ] Add `get_due_cards()` method to filter cards ready for review
   - [ ] Add `get_cards_by_difficulty(difficulty)` method for filtering
4. **Update testDeck function** (`testFunctions.py`):

   - [ ] Add option to study "All cards" vs "Due cards only"
   - [ ] Show next review time for each card
   - [ ] Display how many cards are due vs total

### Other Enhancements (Lower Priority):

- [ ] Add session timer to track study time
- [ ] Add study session summary with statistics
- [ ] Implement "review only difficult cards" filter

## Long-term Goals

- **Robust spaced repetition algorithm** similar to Anki
- **Beautiful, intuitive web interface**
- **Mobile-first responsive design**
- **Community deck sharing**
- **Advanced analytics and progress tracking**

---

## Notes

- Focus on getting console version 100% working before web migration
- Prioritize core learning algorithm over fancy features
- Keep user experience simple and focused
- Plan for scalability in web version
